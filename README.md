## 💡 About Me

I'm a certified Front-End Developer, recently graduated from Medieinstitutet, with a strong foundation in responsive design, modern JavaScript frameworks, and collaborative development.

Before shifting careers, I spent over a decade as an IT pedagogue and teacher — an experience that sharpened my communication skills and strengthened my ability to explain complex ideas clearly across teams.
